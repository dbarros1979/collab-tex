# ✨ Collab-Tex  
_Redesigning Academic LaTeX Collaboration_

---

## 🚀 What is Collab-Tex?

**Collab-Tex** is a collaborative platform for reviewing **LaTeX documents**.  
Reviewers and authors can **edit**, **suggest improvements**, and **track PDFs in real time** — all without installing any software.

📌 Think of it as a simple, open alternative to Overleaf.

---

## 🔄 How it works

1. **Edit directly in GitHub**  
   - Click any `.tex` file → **Edit** → propose your changes.  
   - Create a **Pull Request** to submit your suggestions.

2. **Automatic PDF preview via GitHub Pages**  
   - Every change triggers a **GitHub Actions workflow** that recompiles the PDF.  
   - The updated PDF is served automatically from the `docs/` folder via **GitHub Pages**.

3. **Suggest improvements**  
   - Comment on Pull Requests or propose changes directly in `.tex` files.  
   - The PDF will update automatically after each workflow run.

## 📄 Preview PDF via Pages (Non-Technical Reviewers)

To make reviewing as simple as possible, we provide **direct links to the latest compiled PDF** for each branch.  
Click the link to open the PDF — no setup required.

| Branch Name       | PDF Preview Link                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `main`           | [View PDF](https://dbarros1979.github.io/collab-tex//main.pdf) |
| `draft`          | [View PDF](https://dbarros1979.github.io/collab-tex/draft.pdf) |
| `feature-x`      | [View PDF](https://dbarros1979.github.io/collab-tex//feature-x.pdf) |

> ⚠️ Tip: The PDF on Pages always reflects the **latest workflow run** for that branch.
